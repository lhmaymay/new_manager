How to craft an email?

short, to the point, and only when necessary

1: 1st and 2nd sentence to call out the actions needed, if no action is needed, also make it clear.
   Give people clear direction and communicate clearly about your expectation.
   comunicate with purpose and clarity
2: always explain the "why" part when you asked people to do things

example: 
   your activity report is mandatory and due this Wednesday. Download the report at this URL.
   complete and email it to me by noon on Wednesday. 
   These reports are used by our managers during our performance evaluations.
   
   changed to softer tone:
  Our activity report is mandatory and due this Wednesday. Please Download the report at this URL.
   Complete and email it to me by noon on Wednesday.

2: Action was clear and easy to take (if no actions needed, maybe the email is not necessary)
3: Details limited to only what is most relevant to the reader 
4: Pay attention to the tone, soften the tone
5: Message is tailored to knowledge of reader 
6: Is email the best channel choice? or should you call a quick meeting? chat?
7: The timing of message is good for the reader, is this the best time to send this email?
