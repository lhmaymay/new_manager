Here are good questions to ask your new team (click each of the questions below to learn more about the topic):

1) What are your favorite things to work on? What do you feel are your strengths?
2) What have your past managers done that you’d like me to also do or not do?
3) What are your career goals and where did your last manager leave off with them?
4) How do you like to receive feedback? What works best for you?
5) How do you like to receive praise or recognition?
6) What’s something you do regularly outside of work that’s really important to you?
